# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project for [The Odin Project]
(https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations Course.

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML skills by building a
basic recipe website. It includes a main index page that links to
individual recipe pages.                           
         
## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Structuring a multi-page website
- Using relative file paths for links and images
- Organizing content using lists, headings, and paragraphs
- Creating commits with clear messages

This project is purely focused on HTML. Styling with CSS will come later
in the course.
