        <!-- Description -->
         
        <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a rich and creamy Italian pasta dish made with eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta, and freshly ground black pepper. It’s a quick meal that’s comforting, savory, and comes together in under 30 minutes with just a handful of ingredients. Traditional carbonara doesn’t use cream — the silky sauce is made by combining hot pasta with the egg and cheese mixture.</p>
