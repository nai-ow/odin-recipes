        <p>Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and gooey melted mozzarella. It's the ultimate comfort food - baked until bubbling and golden brown, perfect for feeding a crowd or saving as leftovers. Each bite delivers a perfect balanced of savory, cheesy, and saucy goodness.</p>
